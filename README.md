I started out as a Linguistics major, mostly because I'm a fan of the wonderfully messy ways people communicate‚Äîpidgins, creoles, all the 'dirty' languages that break the rules.

Turns out, that love for finding patterns in chaos is perfect for the tech world. Deconstructing a creole language isn't all that different from parsing unstructured web data or cleaning a chaotic dataset. Both have their own weird syntax, and both are incredibly satisfying to figure out. I‚Äôm a data person at heart, but with a healthy dose of cybersecurity paranoia.

* üî≠ **What I'm focused on**: Finding a full-time role in **Data Analysis** or **Data Engineering** where I can tackle complex, messy data. I'm also interested in security analytics roles that merge both of my passions.
* üí¨ **Ask me about**: Why data cleaning is 80% of the work and 100% of the fun, how to build a web scraper from a simple debugging session, or my latest database project.

### ‚≠ê Featured Projects

These are a few of my favorite projects. They're pinned below, but here's the story behind them.

1.  **[TrueCar Web Scraper](https://github.com/sycstitch/truecar-webscraper)**: It all started when my mom asked for help with a text extract error. That simple debugging session somehow spiraled into this - a full-blown web scraper to pull market data. It was the first time I tackled a problem I knew nothing about from start to finish and won. Made me think, "damn, maybe I *am* more capable than I thought."
2.  **[La Liga Management System](https://github.com/sycstitch/la-liga-management-system)**: A high-stakes clash of titans, not just on the pitch, but in the database. This project involved building a secure management system from the ground up while running dramatic salary analytics - pitting Real Madrid's entire payroll against Barcelona's average in a battle of nested SQL subqueries.
3.  **[Fleet SQL Analytics](https://github.com/sycstitch/taxi-fleet-sql-analytics/tree/main)**: My deep-dive into a simulated taxi company's database to figure out why things were so inefficient. I used everything from [basic queries to advanced window functions to discover that only 45% of certified drivers were actually driving](https://github.com/sycstitch/taxi-fleet-sql-analytics/blob/main/queries.md#overall-business-insights--conclusions). An operational nightmare, but a fantastic data puzzle.
4.  **BTL1 Incident Response Write-Up**: I'm under an NDA, so I can't share the gory details of the incident. This write-up instead focuses on the human element: the story of surviving the 24-hour BTL1 practical exam, the pressure, the problem-solving process, and what it takes to earn the Gold certification.

### üí° Core Competencies

This is a summary of what I bring to the table, based on my project experience and training.

* **Data Analysis & Business Intelligence**
    * Developing advanced SQL queries (Window Functions, CTEs, complex JOINs) for data analysis and business intelligence reporting.
    * Building automated ETL pipelines for web scraping, data cleaning, and validation using Python, Pandas, and BeautifulSoup.
    * Performing statistical analysis to identify trends, optimize processes, and deliver actionable recommendations.

* **Security Analytics & Incident Response**
    * Correlating security logs and detecting anomalies with SIEM tools like Splunk.
    * Conducting digital forensics by analyzing disk and memory images to reconstruct incident timelines.
    * Applying threat intelligence frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK for comprehensive threat analysis.

* **Systems & Infrastructure**
    * Administering Linux (Debian) and Windows Server environments, including Active Directory and Group Policy management.
    * Automating system tasks and file organization using advanced Bash scripting.
    * Designing and implementing normalized relational database schemas for complex applications.
